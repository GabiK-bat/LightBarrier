The R Markdown files should be opened via the R project file ("CountingDark.R") in RStudio for setting up the correct working directory.

R Markdown file "000_Pipeline" is the full pipeline to analyse light barrier data from a hibernaculum and use the number of emerging bats in spring to estimate site-level population size and trends, when data is available over multiple years. The pipeline combines together both R and Python chunks, therefore the installation of Python 3 and the indicated packages is also required to run the full script.

R Markdown and Python files (001-009) were used to create the tables and figures presented in the publication.
